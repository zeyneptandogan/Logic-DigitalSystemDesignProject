### A Simple Telephone Conversation

In the scope of this project, it is required to design a sequential circuit for a simple two-sided telephone conversation and 
implement it using Verilog HDL. Then, Simulation is performed and its functional correctness is shown by
using Xilinx ISE tool. Basically, the caller initiates a telephone conversation with the 
callee and the caller sends characters to the callee (and vice versa). The circuit calculates the cost of the call and send the cost value and the characters (sent from the caller to
callee and vice versa) as outputs. 

There are 8 inputs to the system and 2 outputs are taken at the end of the conversation.

For this, there are 6 different states as it is shown in the state diagram. The details of the implementation can be found in the project report.
